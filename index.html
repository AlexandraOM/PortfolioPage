      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hopefully from the new "variable" I created you'll find that my name is
        Alexandra (O'Mahony) and I'm applying to the Winter Cohort for Founders
        and Coders.<br />
        <br />
        A bit about me: well I'm big on adventure and challenges. I did French,
        Spanish and history at university and have been able to use my languages
        as I travel to meet new people and learn as much as I can about where
        I'm living. In my time abroad, I've learnt to dance Salsa, Bachata and
        Merengue and I've improved (I hope) my travel photography too. I'm a
        people person and as you'll see in my image carousel below, they are
        mostly the subjects in my photography.<br />
        <br />
        It's been two years since I graduated from the University of Nottingham.
        In the first year I worked in a micro-loans charity, Deki, in Bristol
        and then moved to the Dominican Republic to work with UN Women as part
        of their e-learning campus. There I was involved with the creation of
        online courses, from research to packaging and the program coordination
        of face-to-face trainings - in French, Spanish and English. I was really
        lucky to be able build on my teaching experiences and to work on the
        International Office of Migration's (IOM) course on Gender in
        Migration.<br />
        <br />
        Issues around migration were what most motivated to work with charities
        or for Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). I've learnt load from both
        experiences however, I found the pace of work too slow and the level of
        responsibility restricted. And so, I decided to work for a tech start-up
        where I knew I could find more of both.<br />

      <h2>Why Coding</h2>
      <p>
        In October last year I started working at Personably in a sales role.
        When I showed an interest in learning coding basics so that I could
        understand what was going on in product meetings, the founders
        encouraged me to look at Code First: Girls. I started the beginner’s
        course on the basics of building a website and as the weeks went on I
        got more and more hooked.<br />
        <br />
        The working environment at Personably also helped change my perception
        of the tech industry. Our team worked collaboratively, we were
        encouraged to give candid feedback and as a young start-up there was a
        sense too that we were all learning together. It was really exciting to
        be able to take on projects of my own and see changes being made in real
        time. We were also building a product that focussed on improving
        people's life at work, which to me was a really important part of what
        we did.<br />
        <br />
        Before working at Personably, I had thought of the tech industry as a
        world where people hid behind computer screens never speaking to their
        colleagues. Or the more recent trend of tech start-ups (in San-Francisco
        especially) of male dominated environments where a lad culture
        persisted. Neither of these appealed to me and, I think, have put off a
        lot of other people just like me.<br />
        <br />
        I’ve been able to find a lot of those people by joining groups and
        attending events with codebar.io, NodeGirls, React.JS Girls and more
        that support minorities in tech. Now I am feeling really positive about
        the future of the tech industry and of my place in it. <br />
      </p>

    <div id="WhyFandC" class="container">
      <h2>Why Founders and Coders</h2>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed the first Code First: Girls cohort and so decided to go
        on to do the Python course, while also using FreeCodeCamp to learn more
        Java Script. I realised pretty quickly it would be difficult to learn
        the syntax of two languages at once! So once the course was over, I
        decided to dedicate my time solely to Javascript.<br />
        <br />
        Two of my colleagues at Personably are FAC alumni and so I had real
        evidence that FAC were literally producing great founders and coders! I
        did my own research on several bootcamps and FAC's bootcamp model stood
        out most to me, as something I wanted to be a part of. <br />
        <br />
        The first thing that attracted me to FAC was the sense of community and
        the collaborative approach to learning that they share with other groups
        I'm now part of. I like to build up projects with everyone bouncing
        ideas off one another. When I've done this in the past, it's taught me
        to see things from many more viewpoints, not just my own. I also really
        like how each cohort teaches the next and the emphasis on growing a
        community of FAC alumni supporting each other. It reiterates the value
        of inclusivity in tech and is really cool to see. This ethos and the
        support available have helped me a lot so far in my learning and so I
        really want that to continue!<br />
        <br />
        The part of the course I will most be looking forward to doing is the
        second part, when we get to work on the 'Tech for Better' projects. It
        looks like a really exciting challenge! Coming from a background of
        wanting to work in charities and NGOs these are exactly the kind of
        projects I want to be working on while learning with the kind of
        companies I want to work for in the future.<br />
