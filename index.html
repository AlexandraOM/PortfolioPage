      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hopefully from the new "variable" I created you'll find that my name is
        Alexandra (O'Mahony) and I'm applying to the Winter Cohort for Founders
        and Coders.<br />
        <br />
        A bit about me: well I'm big on adventure and challenges. I did French,
        Spanish and history at university and have been able to use my languages
        as I travel to meet new people and learn as much as I can about where
        I'm living. In my time abroad, I've learnt to dance Salsa, Bachata and
        Merengue and I've improved (I hope) my travel photography too. I'm a
        people person and as you'll see in my image carousel below, they are
        mostly the subjects in my photography.<br />
        <br />
        It's been two years since I graduated from the University of Nottingham.
        In the first year I worked in a micro-loans charity, Deki, in Bristol
        and then moved to the Dominican Republic to work with UN Women as part
        of their e-learning campus. There I was involved with the creation of
        online courses, from research to packaging and the program coordination
        of face-to-face trainings - in French, Spanish and English. I was really
        lucky to be able build on my teaching experiences and to work on the
        International Office of Migration's (IOM) course on Gender in
        Migration.<br />
        <br />
        Issues around migration were what most motivated to work for charities
        or for Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO). I learnt loads from both
        experiences but, decided I wanted to more experiences and so, found work
        in a tech start-up that I believed had a great vision for the future of
        work.<br />

      <h2>Why Coding</h2>
      <p>
        In October last year I started working at Personably in a sales role.
        When I showed an interest in learning coding basics so that I could
        understand what was going on in product meetings, the founders
        encouraged me to look at Code First: Girls. I started the beginners
        course on the basics of building a website and as the weeks went on I
        got more and more hooked.<br />
        <br />
        The working environment at Personably also helped change my perception
        of the tech industry. Our team worked collaboratively; we were
        encouraged to give candid feedback and as a young start-up there was a
        sense too that we were all learning together. It was really exciting to
        be able to take on projects of my own and see changes being made in real
        time. We were also building a product that focussed on improving
        people's life at work, which was a great motivator for me.<br />
        <br />
        Before working at Personably, I had thought of the tech industry as a
        world where people hid behind computer screens never speaking to their
        colleagues. Or the more recent trend of tech start-ups (in San-Francisco
        especially) of male dominated environments where a lad culture
        persisted. Neither of these appealed to me and, I think, have put off a
        lot of other people just like me.<br />
        <br />
        I’ve been able to find a lot of those people by joining groups and
        attending events with codebar.io, NodeGirls, React.JS Girls and more
        that support minorities in tech. Now I am feeling really positive about
        the future of the tech industry and of my place in it. <br />

    <div id="WhyFandC" class="container">
      <h2>Why Founders and Coders</h2>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed the first Code First: Girls cohort and so decided to go
        on to do the Python course, while also using FreeCodeCamp to learn more
        Java Script. I realised pretty quickly it would be difficult to learn
        the syntax of two languages at once! So once the course was over, I
        decided to dedicate my time solely to Javascript.<br />
        <br />
        Two of my colleagues at Personably are FAC alumni and so I had real
        evidence that FAC were literally producing great founders and coders! I
        did my own research on several bootcamps and FAC's bootcamp model stood
        out most to me, as something I wanted to be a part of. <br />
        <br />
        The first thing that attracted me to FAC was the sense of community and
        the collaborative approach to learning that they share with other groups
        I'm now part of. I like to build up projects with everyone bouncing
        ideas off one another. When I've done this in the past, it's taught me
        to see things from many more viewpoints, not just my own. I also really
        like how each cohort teaches the next and the emphasis on growing a
        community of FAC alumni supporting each other. It reiterates the value
        of inclusivity in tech and is really cool to see. This ethos and the
        support available have helped me a lot so far in my learning and so I
        really want that to continue!<br />
        <br />
        The part of the course I will most be looking forward to doing is the
        second part, when we get to work on the 'Tech for Better' projects. It
        looks like a really exciting challenge! Coming from a background of
        wanting to work in charities and NGOs these are exactly the kind of
        projects I want to be working on while learning with the kind of
        companies I want to work for in the future.<br />

      <h2>What I've learnt</h2>
      <p>
        Well...I could write a very, very long list of things I wish I had known
        before starting my website! From little things such as making sure the
        script tags are at the end of the html, and how to use the 'pre' tag, to
        the big things such as flex box and grids - and of course the carousel
        struggles! All in all though, I'm really happy with my website and how
        much I've learnt from Codewars and Free Code Camp in the past couple of
        months. <br />
        <br />
        Back in May I watched a talk about the easy steps to introducing basic
        accessibility into your website by Marcy Sutton at the ReactJS Girls
        conference. The two main tips I took away were: make sure your entire
        website could be accessed via the keyboard (i.e. using the tab key,
        enter etc not the mouse) and use Chrome developer tools to check the
        visibility of your font colour vs. background colour. So from the outset
        these two things were really important for me to be able to achieve, as
        I want accessibility to be considered in every project I do. <br />
        <br />
        My favourite colour is orange and so, using the Chrome dev tools, I
        found an orange that was easily viewed on a white and pale orange
        background. I then used only three more colours on my website: white,
        black and grey, and in doing so I was able to maintain consistency
        throughout with the visible accessibility I wanted! <br />
        <br />
        You're able to navigate through all links in the entire website using
        the tab and enter keys on the menu or up and down using the arrow keys.
        I also really wanted to introduce key functions into my carousel
        Javascript. You'll be able to use the space bar to pause and the left
        and right arrow keys to scroll through the images. <br />
        <br />
        One big lesson I took from someone on the current cohort was that the
        little things can make a big difference. I've added animations such as
        transitions on loading, smooth scrolling and more and they've made such
        a difference, in my opinion, to the polished feel of the end product. Of
        course it's also really important to inject a bit of personality into
        the website - and so the header "variable" although a little gimicky was
        fun to put in. <br />
        <br />
        Finally the thing I kept coming back to was readability in my code. I've
        been in a constant state of learning while doing and while some days
        I've been able to create loads of code and understand it, days later I
        might come back and not understand what or why I did something. And so
        I've used lots of comments in my Javascript and headers in my html and
        css. <br />
        <br />
        I think that leads well into what I would like to improve on in the
        future. I feel like, particularly in my CSS, there was a lot of
        repetition in my code and with that, whenever I made changes I could
        easily lose consistency throughout the whole doc. I had also planned to
        do the Free Code Camp lessons in CSS, Grids and Flexibility as I went
        along. However, looking back I wish I'd had all that information
        available before I started the project!<br />
