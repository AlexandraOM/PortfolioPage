      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        From the "variable" above, you'll see that my name is Alexandra
        (O'Mahony) and I'm applying to the Winter Cohort of Founders and Coders.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        About me: well, I love a good challenge. I studied French, Spanish and
        History at the University of Nottingham. I've used these languages as
        much as possible to meet new people and learn as much as I can about
        wherever I am. I've been lucky enough to live abroad and have made the
        most of that time by learning to dance Salsa, Bachata and Merengue,
        which I now try to do as often as possible back in London. I also spent
        a lot of time improving my photography - I've shared a few of my
        favourites below. </p>
        <br />
      <p>After I graduated, I looked for work in international development. This
        lead to a role at Deki, a Bristol based micro-loans charity, before
        moving to the Dominican Republic in early 2018. In the DR I worked for
        the UN Women e-Learning Campus in the creation of online courses. Issues
        around migration are what most motivated to look for work with
        Non-Governmental Organisations. So, I was particularly excited to build
        on my teaching experiences and contribute to the International Office of
        Migration's 'Gender in Migration' course.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p> I've learnt a lot from my experiences so far and still want a future
        working in development. However, from my time at the e-Learning Campus I
        learnt that there are so many ways to work in this field. With that in
        mind, I decided to look a different approach.

      <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In October 2018 I started in a sales role at Personably in a sales role.
        I was interested in learning the coding basics so that I could engage
        more in product meetings. Off the back of this, I was introduced to Code
        First: Girls. I started their beginners course on the basics of building
        a website and as the weeks went on I was more and more hooked.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        The Personably team helped shift my view of the tech industry. As a
        young start-up there was a sense that we were all learning together: we
        worked collaboratively and were encouraged to give candid feedback. I
        found it exciting to take on projects and see them develop in real time.
        Another great motivator for me was that our product focussed on
        improving people's life at work, which I could relate to.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        Before Personably, I imagined the tech industry either as a world where
        people hid behind computer screens never speaking to each other or as a
        male dominated environment where a sexist culture persisted. Neither of
        these appealed to me and I'm sure put off a lot of other people, too.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        <span>I’ve met a lot of those people through <a href=https://codebar.io/ >codebar.io</a>, <a href=https://nodegirls.com/london>NodeGirls</a>, <a href=https://reactjsgirls.com>ReactJS Girls</a> and <a href=https://djangogirls.org>django girls</a> that all support minorities in tech. I'm now positive about the future
        of the tech industry and of my place in it.</span>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="WhyFandC" class="container">
      <h2>Why Founders and Coders?</h2>
      <p>
        <br />
        I enjoyed the beginners Code First: Girls course so decided to move on
        to the Python course, while also using freeCodeCamp to learn more
        JavaScript. I quickly realised it would be difficult to learn the syntax
        of two languages at once, so once the course was over, I decided to
        focus my learning on JavaScript. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Two colleagues at Personably were FAC alumni. Their description of the
        course environment matched what I was looking for and so, when deciding
        on a next step in my coding journey, Founders and Coders was the obvious
        choice.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        The main thing that attracts me to FAC is its sense of community and
        collaborative approach to learning. In all my experiences, the best
        projects and results have come from bouncing ideas off other people.
        It's taught me to see things from many more viewpoints, not just my own.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        I also really like how each cohort teaches the next and the emphasis on
        growing a community of FAC alumni that support one another. It
        reiterates the value of inclusivity in tech and is really cool to see.
        This ethos and the support available have helped me a lot so far in my
        learning and so I really want that to continue!
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        I'm most looking to the second part of the course, when we get to work
        on the 'Tech for Better' projects. It looks like a really exciting
        challenge! Coming from a background of working in charities and NGOs
        these are exactly the kind of projects I want to be working on, while
        learning.

      <h2>What have I learnt?</h2>

        <br />
      <p>
        Well, I could write a very, very long list of things I wish I had known
        before starting my website! From little things such as making sure the
        script tags are at the end of the html, and how to use the 'pre' tag, to
        the big things such as FlexBox and grids - and of course the carousel
        struggles! All in all though, I'm really happy with my website and how
        much I've learnt from Codewars and freeCodeCamp in the past couple of
        months.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        <span> Back in May I watched a talk about the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkl6sYff2C8&list=PLfrHCOIcmSupF372EGlyi3l4y2R7F8A3q&t=16822s>easy steps to introducing basic
        accessibility into your website by Marcy Sutton</a> at the ReactJS Girls
        conference. The two main tips I took away were: make sure your entire
        website can be accessed via the keyboard (e.g. using the tab key, enter
        etc., not the mouse) and use Chrome developer tools to check the
        visibility of your font colour vs. background colour. So from the outset
        of this project, I wanted to build in accessibility. I am really happy
        with the results and I will continue to consider this a key aspect in
        any future work.</span>
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        I also wanted to make sure my personality came across, not just for the
        viewer but also for myself. My favourite colour is orange and so, using
        the Chrome dev tools, I found an orange that contrasted well against the
        white and pale orange background. I then used just two different greys and white to keep consistency throughout my website and also increase accessibility.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        You'll find that you can navigate through all links using the tab and
        enter keys on the menu or up and down using the arrow keys. I introduced
        key functions into my carousel JavaScript so you can use the space bar
        to pause and the left and right arrow keys to scroll through the images.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        I've also been focussing on improving the readability of my code. I've
        rewritten parts of my code as I've learnt new tricks and I'm also now in
        the habit of writing comments and headers so I can easily return to
        areas I want to improve.
      </p>
        <br />
      <p>
        I think utilising FlexBox in more of the website would improve
        functionality. I thought that the suggestions I got from the Gitter chat
        were useful, and while the games helped me identify certain issues,
        there is still plenty to learn!

      <p> I will be out of the country from the 5th-20th of September (over the
        interview week) on a trip to Cuba, where there is a very limited access
        to internet. I organised this back in November 2018, before I knew I'd be applying for FAC.
