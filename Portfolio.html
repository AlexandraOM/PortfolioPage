      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Alexandra O’Mahony I’m from Bristol and moved to London in
        October 2018 to start in a sales role in a tech startup. I love learning
        and I seem to take on topics - such as coding - where the learning never
        stops. I did languages and history at university and have since lived in
        France, Spain, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. I love to travel;
        learning about new places, meeting new people and improving my French,
        Spanish, dancing and photography as I go. You’ll find some of my travel
        photography in the image carousel below. <br />
        <br />
        After graduating in 2017 I worked with a micro-loan charity for
        international development before moving to the Dominican Republic to
        work for UN Women. I was involved with the creation of online courses,
        from research to packaging and the program coordination of face-to-face
        trainings - in French, Spanish and English. I was very fortunate to be
        able build on my teaching experiences and be given the opportunity to
        work on the International Office of Migration's (IOM) course on Gender
        in Migration. <br />
        <br />
        For a long time I was certain I wanted to work in a Non-Governmental
        Organisation (NGO). I am still really interested in international
        development, however, I found the pace of work too slow and the level of
        responsibility restricted. I decided to work for a tech start-up where I
        knew I could find more of both.

      <h2>Why Coding</h2>
      <p>
        In October 2018 I started working at Personably in a sales role. When I
        expressed an interest in learning coding basics so that I could
        understand what was going on in product meetings, the founders were
        really encouraging. I attended a beginner’s course with Code First:
        Girls on the basics of building a website. As I learnt more I became
        more hooked. <br />
        <br />
        Previously I had thought of the tech industry as a world where people
        hid behind computer screens never speaking to their colleagues. Or the
        more recent trend of tech start-ups (in San-Francisco especially) of
        male dominated environments where a lad culture dominated. Neither of
        these appealed to me. However, I’ve now found a community of minorities
        in tech from joining and attending events with codebar.io, NodeGirls,
        React.JS Girls and more and am feeling really positive about the future
        of the tech industry and of my place in it. <br />
        <br />
        The working environment at Personably also helped change my perception
        of the tech industry. Our team worked collaboratively and as a young
        start-up there was a sense too that we were all in it together and we
        were encouraged to give feedback in order to progress. It was really
        exciting to be able to take on projects of my own and see changes being
        made in real time.

        After finishing the first Code First: Girls cohort I went on to do the
        Python course, and started using FreeCodeCamp to learn more Java Script.
        Two of my colleagues at Personably are FAC alumni and they encouraged me
        to look into the program. I really like the model that FAC work with and
        I can see FAC share a lot of values around approach to learning and
        community with other groups I'm now part of. For me the best way to
        learn is through full immersion and learning by doing. In this way the
        possibility of working with charities to build help build products for
        them while on the course, looks like a really exciting challenge for me.
        <br />
        <br />
        The community aspect of the course, with each cohort teaching the
        previous; an emphasis on pair-programming and the growing community of
        FAC alumni supporting each other, is also really important to me. This
        ethos and the support available have helped so far in my way of learning
        and so I really want that to continue!
